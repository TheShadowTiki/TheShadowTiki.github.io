## Philosophy

Scientific progress requires sustainable intellectual infrastructure. My approach to leadership is systems-based: identifying bottlenecks in the research ecosystem—whether in knowledge access, student training, or interdisciplinary collaboration—and designing structural solutions to address them.

## Knowledge Translation & Communication

**PaperADay (In Development)**  
*Founder & Lead*  
A forthcoming science communication initiative designed to lower the activation energy required to engage with primary literature.

* **Vision:** "Make real science (science literature) fun and exciting for everyone, every day."
* **Mechanism:** Developing a platform to translate dense computational neuroscience papers into accessible, daily summaries that retain technical rigor while stripping away jargon barriers.

**Research Chalk Talks & Journal Clubs**  
*Discussion Lead*  
I prioritize the skill of "board-work" communication—explaining complex mathematical concepts (e.g., linear algebra, dynamical systems) in real-time without slides. I regularly organize and lead peer discussions to practice translating formal proofs into intuitive physical arguments.

## Research Culture & Institution Building

**STEMCORE (STEM Collaboration and Research Initiative)**  
*Founder & President*  
Identified a structural gap in undergraduate research access: motivated students often lack the specific technical skills required to join computational labs.

* **Action:** Founded an interdisciplinary organization to provide "on-ramp" training.
* **Impact:** Organized technical seminar series and skill-building workshops, creating a pipeline for students to acquire research-ready skills before applying to labs.

**Bioinformatics Club**  
*President*  
Lead the organization of technical workshops and guest lectures, fostering a community of practice for students at the intersection of biology and computer science.

## Academic Mentorship

**Honors College Peer Mentor & Learning Assistant**  
*University of South Florida*  
Formal instruction and mentorship roles for the Honors Foundations and Cancer Biology courses.

* **Role:** Facilitated discussion sections and guided first-year honors students in developing academic strategies.
* **Objective:** To move beyond content delivery and teach the *metacognitive* skills required for rigorous academic inquiry.

**PAMSA Tutoring Officer**  
Designed and managed tutoring structures to support student success in pre-medical and science coursework.

## Civic Systems Design

**Mayor's Youth Leadership Council**  
*Tampa, FL*  
Early experience in civic systems design. Worked with city officials to analyze community needs and design structural interventions for youth engagement. This experience grounded my belief that effective leadership requires understanding the system before attempting to optimize it.
