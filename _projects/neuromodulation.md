*CSHL (Zador Lab) | Python, JAX, Flax, Brax, PPO*

* **Problem:** Standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles to generalize to related tasks without extensive retraining.
* **Method:** Implemented a generalized model of neuromodulation that navigates a "weight manifold" rather than optimizing single weights. Engineered custom wrappers in **JAX/Brax** to integrate this manifold approach with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
* **Outcome:** Created transformation-safe architectures for continuous control tasks and visualized the optimization landscape using Manim. (See Preprint).
