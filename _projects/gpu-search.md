*HPC Lab (Tu Lab) | C++, CUDA, Parallel Computing*

* **Problem:** Nearest neighbor search in large-scale biological databases (e.g., DNA alignment) is computationally expensive.
* **Method:** Designed a parallelized search algorithm for Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs. Optimized memory access patterns and thread divergence on NVIDIA GPUs.
* **Outcome:** Achieved significant speedup over CPU-only implementations.
