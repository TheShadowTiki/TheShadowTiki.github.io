*TKAI Lab (Mali Lab) | Python, Brian2, Evolutionary Algorithms*

* **Problem:** Linking mechanistic spiking activity to functional input-output behavior in the auditory pathway.
* **Method:** Utilized **CNModel** to generate synthetic cochlear nucleus spike trains. Applied evolutionary meta-heuristic algorithms to optimize parameters of biologically plausible Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with STDP learning rules.
* **Outcome:** Demonstrated convergence of mechanistic models toward biological reference data; presented at NCUR 2025.
