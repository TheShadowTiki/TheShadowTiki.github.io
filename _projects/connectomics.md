*ADCL (Spirou Lab) | Python, SLURM, Deep Learning (CDeep3M)*

* **Problem:** Segmenting mitochondria in Electron Microscopy (EM) volumes is a bottleneck for 3D reconstruction.
* **Method:** Developed a semi-automated "Human-in-the-Loop" proofreading workflow. Implemented HPC workflows using **SLURM** to parallelize deep learning segmentation across large image volumes.
* **Outcome:** Significantly improved segmentation accuracy and efficiency; presented at the BRAIN Initiative Conference.
